Transcription:

> Imagine you have to make a puppy house for your new puppy. This could work well for *one* puppy, but what if you get a new puppy ever week? No matter how good you are at making puppy houses, that won't scale well. Maintenance is also a problem.
**Configuration Management** allows you to streamline your infrastructure setup by defining a number of standard procedures for new servers. In the context of servers, configuration management tools will automate these procedures based on *provisioning scripts*.
By using configuration management, you'll assure that no matter who builds your puppy houses, they'll always look the same.

### Benefits

Some of the benefits of using configuration management include:

- Turning your infrastructure into code, and being able to version control it
- Ability to quickly recover from critical errors by spinning up new servers with the exact same configuration
- Sharing the same environment with coworkers and between different servers (testing, staging, production)

### Configuration Management Tools

- [Ansible](https://ansible.com)
- [Chef](https://www.chef.io/)
