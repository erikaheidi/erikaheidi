We want to hear from you. Have you contributed to open source in the past? Which projects are more inclusive and open to new contributors? Who should support open source maintainers? 

Take a few minutes to [participate in our Currents 2020 survey](http://do.co/currents2020) and help us understand and report back on the state of open source in 2020. Data will remain confidential and used only for the purposes of the report. After taking the survey, you'll be able to opt in to receive a limited-edition open source Sammy sticker or contribute a tree to our DigitalOcean Forest!
